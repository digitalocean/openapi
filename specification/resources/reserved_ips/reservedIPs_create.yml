summary: Create a New Reserved IP

description: >-
  On creation, a reserved IP must be either assigned to a Droplet or reserved
  to a region.

  * To create a new reserved IP assigned to a Droplet, send a POST
    request to `/v2/reserved_ips` with the `droplet_id` attribute.

  * To create a new reserved IP reserved to a region, send a POST request to
    `/v2/reserved_ips` with the `region` attribute.

  **Note**:  In addition to the standard rate limiting, only 12 reserved IPs may
  be created per 60 seconds.
