summary: List Neighbors for a Droplet

description: |
  To retrieve a list of any "neighbors" (i.e. Droplets that are co-located on
  the same physical hardware) for a specific Droplet, send a GET request to
  `/v2/droplets/$DROPLET_ID/neighbors`.

  The results will be returned as a JSON object with a key of `droplets`. This
  will be set to an array containing objects representing any other Droplets
  that share the same physical hardware. An empty array indicates that the
  Droplet is not co-located any other Droplets associated with your account.
