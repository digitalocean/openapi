operationId: droplets_destroy_withAssociatedResourcesDangerous

summary: Destroy a Droplet and All of its Associated Resources (Dangerous)

description: |
  To destroy a Droplet along with all of its associated resources, send a DELETE
  request to the `/v2/droplets/$DROPLET_ID/destroy_with_associated_resources/dangerous`
  endpoint. The headers of this request must include an `X-Dangerous` key set to
  `true`. To preview which resources will be destroyed, first query the
  Droplet's associated resources. This operation _can not_ be reverse and should
  be used with caution.

  A successful response will include a 202 response code and no content. Use the
  status endpoint to check on the success or failure of the destruction of the
  individual resources.
