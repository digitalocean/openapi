  A tag is a label that can be applied to a resource (currently Droplets, Images, Volumes, Volume Snapshots, and Database clusters)
  in order to better organize or facilitate the lookups and actions on it.

  Tags have two attributes: a user defined `name` attribute and an embedded `resources` attribute with information about resources that have been tagged.

properties:

  name:
    type: string
    description: |
      The name of the tag. Tags may contain letters, numbers, colons, dashes, and underscores.
      There is a limit of 255 characters per tag.

      **Note:** Tag names are case stable, which means the capitalization you use when you first create a tag is canonical.

      When working with tags in the API, you must use the tag's canonical capitalization. For example, if you create a tag named "PROD", the URL to add that tag to a resource would be `https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/tags/PROD/resources` (not `/v2/tags/prod/resources`).

      Tagged resources in the control panel will always display the canonical capitalization. For example, if you create a tag named "PROD", you can tag resources in the control panel by entering "prod". The tag will still display with its canonical capitalization, "PROD".

  resources:
    type: object
    description: >-
      An embedded object containing key value pairs of resource type and resource statistics.
      It also includes a count of the total number of resources tagged with the current tag as well as a `last_tagged_uri` attribute set to the last resource tagged with the current tag.
