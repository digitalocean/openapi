  The response will be a JSON object with a key called `floating_ip`.
  The value of this will be an object that contains the standard attributes
  associated with a floating IP.

  When assigning a floating IP to a Droplet at same time as it created, the
  response's `links` object will contain links to both the Droplet and the
  assignment action. The latter can be used to check the status of the action.
