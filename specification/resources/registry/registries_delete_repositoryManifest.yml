summary: "[Public Preview] Delete Container Registry Repository Manifest"

description: |
  To delete a container repository manifest by digest in one of your registries, send a DELETE request to
  `/v2/registries/$REGISTRY_NAME/repositories/$REPOSITORY_NAME/digests/$MANIFEST_DIGEST`.

  Note that if your repository name contains `/` characters, it must be
  URL-encoded in the request URL. For example, to delete
  `registry.digitalocean.com/example/my/repo@sha256:abcd`, the path would be
  `/v2/registry/example/repositories/my%2Frepo/digests/sha256:abcd`.

  A successful request will receive a 204 status code with no body in response.
  This indicates that the request was processed successfully.
  
  It is similar to DELETE `/v2/registry/$REGISTRY_NAME/repositories/$REPOSITORY_NAME/digests/$MANIFEST_DIGEST` and exists for backward compatibility.
