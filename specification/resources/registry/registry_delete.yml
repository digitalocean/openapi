  **Note: This endpoint is deprecated. Please use the `/v2/registries` endpoint instead.**

  To delete your container registry, destroying all container image
  data stored in it, send a DELETE request to `/v2/registry`.
  
  This operation is not compatible with multiple registries in a DO account. You should use `/v2/registries/{registry_name}` instead.
