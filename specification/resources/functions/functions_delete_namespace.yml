summary: Delete Namespace

description: >-
  Deletes the given namespace.  When a namespace is deleted all assets, in the namespace are deleted, this
  includes packages, functions and triggers. Deleting a namespace is a destructive operation and assets in the
  namespace are not recoverable after deletion. Some metadata is retained, such as activations, or soft deleted for reporting purposes.

  To delete namespace, send a DELETE request to `/v2/functions/namespaces/$NAMESPACE_ID`.

  A successful deletion returns a 204 response.
