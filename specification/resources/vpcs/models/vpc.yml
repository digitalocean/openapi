vpc_default:
  type: object
  properties:
    default:
      type: boolean
      example: true
      description: A boolean value indicating whether or not the VPC is the
        default network for the region. All applicable resources are placed
        into the default VPC network unless otherwise specified during their
        creation. The `default` field cannot be unset from `true`. If you want
        to set a new default VPC network, update the `default` field of another
        VPC network in the same region. The previous network's `default` field
        will be set to `false` when a new default VPC has been defined.

vpc_create:

  properties:
    region:
      type: string

      description: The range of IP addresses in the VPC in CIDR notation.
        Network ranges cannot overlap with other networks in the same account
          and must be in range of private addresses as defined in RFC1918. It
          may not be smaller than `/28` nor larger than `/16`. If no IP range
          is specified, a `/20` network range is generated that won't conflict
          with other VPC networks in your account.
