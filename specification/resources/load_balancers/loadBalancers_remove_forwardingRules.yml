summary: Remove Forwarding Rules from a Load Balancer

description: |
  To remove forwarding rules from a load balancer instance, send a DELETE
  request to `/v2/load_balancers/$LOAD_BALANCER_ID/forwarding_rules`. In the
  body of the request, there should be a `forwarding_rules` attribute containing
  an array of rules to be removed.

  No response body will be sent back, but the response code will indicate
  success. Specifically, the response code will be a 204, which means that the
  action was successful with no returned body data.
