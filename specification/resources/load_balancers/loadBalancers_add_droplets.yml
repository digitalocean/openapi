operationId: loadBalancers_add_droplets

summary: Add Droplets to a Load Balancer

description: |
  To assign a Droplet to a load balancer instance, send a POST request to
  `/v2/load_balancers/$LOAD_BALANCER_ID/droplets`. In the body of the request,
  there should be a `droplet_ids` attribute containing a list of Droplet IDs.
  Individual Droplets can not be added to a load balancer configured with a
  Droplet tag. Attempting to do so will result in a "422 Unprocessable Entity"
  response from the API.

  No response body will be sent back, but the response code will indicate
  success. Specifically, the response code will be a 204, which means that the
  action was successful with no returned body data.
