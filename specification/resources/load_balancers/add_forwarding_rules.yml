summary: Add Forwarding Rules to a Load Balancer

description: |
  To add an additional forwarding rule to a load balancer instance, send a POST
  request to `/v2/load_balancers/$LOAD_BALANCER_ID/forwarding_rules`. In the body
  of the request, there should be a `forwarding_rules` attribute containing an
  array of rules to be added.

  No response body will be sent back, but the response code will indicate
  success. Specifically, the response code will be a 204, which means that the
  action was successful with no returned body data.
