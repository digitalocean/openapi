    example: example.com

  ip_address:
    type: string

      This value is the time to live for the records on this domain, in seconds.

    type: string
    readOnly: true
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      This attribute contains the complete contents of the zone file for the
      selected domain. Individual domain record resources should be used to get
      more granular control over records. However, this attribute can also be
      used to get information about the SOA record, which is created
      automatically and is not accessible as an individual record resource.
    example: |
      $ORIGIN example.com.
      $TTL 1800
      example.com. IN SOA ns1.digitalocean.com. hostmaster.example.com. 1415982609 10800 3600 604800 1800
      example.com. 1800 IN NS ns1.digitalocean.com.
      example.com. 1800 IN NS ns2.digitalocean.com.
      example.com. 1800 IN NS ns3.digitalocean.com.
      example.com. 1800 IN A 1.2.3.4
