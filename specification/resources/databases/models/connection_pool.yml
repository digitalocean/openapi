    description: >-
      The desired size of the PGBouncer connection pool. The maximum allowed
      size is determined by the size of the cluster's primary node. 25 backend
      server connections are allowed for every 1GB of RAM. Three are reserved
      for maintenance. For example, a primary node with 1 GB of RAM allows for
      a maximum of 22 backend server connections while one with 4 GB would
      allow for 97. Note that these are shared across all connection pools in
      a cluster.
