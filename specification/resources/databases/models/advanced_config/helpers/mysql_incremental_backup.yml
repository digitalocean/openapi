properties:
  enabled:
    description: >- 
      Enable periodic incremental backups. When enabled, full_backup_week_schedule must be set. Incremental backups only store changes since the last backup, making them faster and more storage-efficient than full backups. This is particularly useful for large databases where daily full backups would be too time-consuming or expensive.
    type: boolean
  full_backup_week_schedule:
    description: >-
      Comma-separated list of days of the week when full backups should be created. Valid values: mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat, sun. Default is null. Example : "mon,fri,sun".
