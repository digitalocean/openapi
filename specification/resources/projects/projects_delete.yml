summary: Delete an Existing Project

description: |
  To delete a project, send a DELETE request to `/v2/projects/$PROJECT_ID`. To
  be deleted, a project must not have any resources assigned to it. Any existing
  resources must first be reassigned or destroyed, or you will receive a 412 error.

  A successful request will receive a 204 status code with no body in response.
  This indicates that the request was processed successfully.
