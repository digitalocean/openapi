summary: Validate App Rollback

description: |
  Check whether an app can be rolled back to a specific deployment. This endpoint can also be used
  to check if there are any warnings or validation conditions that will cause the rollback to proceed
  under unideal circumstances. For example, if a component must be rebuilt as part of the rollback
  causing it to take longer than usual.
