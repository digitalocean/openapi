  disable_edge_cache:
    description: |-
      If set to `true`, the app will **not** be cached at the edge (CDN). Enable this option if you want to manage CDN configuration yourselfâ€”whether by using an external CDN provider or by handling static content and caching within your app. This setting is also recommended for apps that require real-time data or serve dynamic content, such as those using Server-Sent Events (SSE) over GET, or hosting an MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server that utilizes SSE.  
      **Note:** This feature is not available for static site components.  
      For more information, see [Disable CDN Cache](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/how-to/cache-content/#disable-cdn-cache).

  disable_email_obfuscation:
