summary: Upgrade App Buildpack

description: |
  Upgrade an app's buildpack to a newer major version line.


  The buildpack must already be part of the app's build
  configuration. The "Retrieve an Existing App" operation will return the app's build configuration. In it, a buildpack
  with a `latest` value of `false` indicates that an major version upgrade is available.


  Before upgrading a buildpack, make sure to inspect its documentation page for the changelog as major version upgrades
  are likely to introduce breaking changes to the buildpack's operation.
