# Contributing

We welcome and encourage contributions from the community. 
Keep in mind that this spec describes the current production API so changes
must reflect actual behavior of the API.

## Development

### Prerequisites

The following tools are required 

* [`Git`](https://git-scm.com/): Interact with the source code
* [`Make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html): Used to maintain
  common commands for use in the development environment or build system
* [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/): For managing dependencies and running tools
* [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com/get-started): For running tools in isolation

### Installation

Once the prerequisites are installed, the source can be downloaded and the 
dependencies can be installed:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:digitalocean/apiv2-openapi.git
cd apiv2-openapi
make preview
```

The `make preview` command starts a local web server with the rendered API docs 
and watches the source files for changes. The rendered docs can be viewed in 
the browser at the address listed in the startup output (http://localhost:8080).

### Tooling

The tooling chosen supports either authoring, validation, testing, or 
publishing. Respective Make target 

* [Spectral](https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral/): JSON/YAML linter with 
  support for OpenAPI v3, custom rules, built-in functions, and custom functions
* [Prism](https://stoplight.io/open-source/prism/): Set of packages to API 
  mocking. Also provides a live validation proxy.
* [OpenAPI CLI](https://github.com/Redocly/openapi-cli): OpenAPI CLI toolbox 
  with rich validation and bundling features.

In addition, the following tools are leveraged to facilitate authoring the spec.

#### Visual Studio Code Extensions

These are useful extensions when choosing to author OpenAPI spec using Visual 
Studio Code.

* [Spectral](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stoplight.spectral): 
  View linting violations inline
* [OpenAPI Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zoellner.openapi-preview): 
  Preview the API spec in SwaggerUI within the editor
* [YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml): 
  Base YAML syntax validation
* [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker): 
  View/Manage containers within the editor sidebar
